# Cypress Project with Cucumber

This repository contains a Cypress project with Cucumber integration for automated end-to-end testing of your web application. By combining the power of Cypress and Cucumber, you can write and execute test scenarios in a more natural, human-readable format.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can run the tests in this project, you need to have the following software installed:

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   git clone https://github.com/Ihnatsiuk/Cypress.git

2. Change to the project directory:

   cd cypress

3. Install the project dependencies:

   npm install

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
cypress-cucumber/
  ├── cypress/
  │   ├── integration/
  │   │   ├── features/
  │   │   │   ├── example.feature
  │   │   │   └── ...
  │   │   └── ...
  │   ├── plugins/
  │   └── ...
  ├── cypress.json
  ├── package.json
  ├── README.md
  └── ...
```

- `cypress/`: Contains Cypress configuration and test files.
- `cypress/integration/features/`: Place your Cucumber feature files here.
- `cypress/plugins/`: Cypress plugins directory.
- `cypress.json`: Cypress configuration file.
- `package.json`: Node.js project configuration and dependencies.

## Writing Tests

### Cucumber Features

Cucumber features are written in Gherkin syntax and reside in the `cypress/integration/features/` directory. Each feature file should have a `.feature` extension. Here's an example feature file:

Feature: User Login

  Scenario: Successful login
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter valid credentials
    Then I should be logged in

### Cypress Step Definitions

Cypress step definitions are implemented in JavaScript and reside in the `cypress/support/step_definitions/` directory. Step definitions are responsible for executing the test actions defined in the feature files. Here's an example step definition:

import { Given, When, Then } from 'cypress-cucumber-preprocessor/steps';

Given('I am on the login page', () => {
  // Implement step logic here
});

When('I enter valid credentials', () => {
  // Implement step logic here
});

Then('I should be logged in', () => {
  // Implement step logic here
});

## Running Tests

To run the Cucumber tests with Cypress, use the following command:

npm run cypress:run

This will execute all the feature files located in the `cypress/integration/features/` directory.

## Reporting

Cypress generates detailed test reports by default. You can find the HTML reports in the `cypress/reports` directory after running the tests. These reports provide information about test results, including failed scenarios and steps.

## Continuous Integration

You can easily integrate this Cypress project with Cucumber into your CI/CD pipeline. Configure your CI service to run the `npm run cypress:run` command, and ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed.

## Best Practices

- Keep your feature files (`cypress/integration/features/`) organized and concise.
- Write clear and descriptive step definitions to make the tests more readable and maintainable.
- Utilize Cypress commands effectively for interacting with your application.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues or have questions about this project, please check the [Cypress documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/) and the [Cucumber documentation](https://cucumber.io/docs/).
